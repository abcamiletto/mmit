# Vision Museum Pytorch

**VMP is a python library with pretrained building blocks for Computer Vision models.**  

## Why VMP?

VMP is a library that provides building blocks for Computer Vision models. Heavily inspired by [SMP](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch), we aim at providing a unified interface for all encoder and decoders, so that any composition is plug and play.
It is designed to be flexible in order to support rapid implementation and evaluation of novel research. It is also designed to be fast, modular, and extensible. VMP is built on top of PyTorch.
